# Guestbook Application with Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift

This repository contains the Guestbook application project, created as part of the "Introduction to Containers with Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift" course on Coursera. The project demonstrates containerization, deployment, scaling, rolling updates/rollbacks, and OpenShift-specific capabilities using Docker, Kubernetes, IBM Cloud Container Registry, and RedHat OpenShift.

## Project Overview
The Guestbook application is a simple web app with a text input form for users to submit messages. The application demonstrates:

1. Building and deploying a containerized application.
2. Managing Kubernetes deployments and pods.
3. Implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
4. Performing rolling updates and rollbacks.
5. Deploying, scaling, and managing the application using OpenShift.

---

## Features
- **Dockerized Application**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for efficient builds.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: YAML configuration for deploying the app.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Auto-adjusts replicas based on CPU usage.
- **Rolling Updates**: Seamless updates to the application.
- **Rollback Capability**: Reverts deployments to previous stable versions.
- **OpenShift Deployment**: Simplified application management with OpenShift tools.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Docker
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)
- IBM Cloud CLI (optional for IBM Cloud Container Registry)
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

---

## Implementation

### 1. Building the Guestbook App Docker Image and Pushing to IBM Cloud Container Registry

- **Exporting namespace as env var, building image, pusing image, verifying image push.**
   ```bash
   export MY_NAMESPACE=sn-labs-$USERNAME
   docker build . -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1
   docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1
   ```

   ![Docker Image in IBM Cloud Container Registry](/images/crimages.png)

### 2. Applying Deployment and Accessing Application By Port Forwarding

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl port-forward deployment.apps/guestbook 3000:3000
```
![Deployed Application on Kubernetes](/images/app.png)

### 3. Autoscaling using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

- **Autoscale the Guestbook deployment.**
   ```bash
   kubectl autoscale deployment guestbook --cpu-percent=5 --min=1 --max=10
   ```

- **Status of newly made HPA.**
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa guestbook
   ```

   ![New HPA](/images/hpa.png)


- **Generating load on the app on the server.**
   ```bash
   kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=busybox:1.36.0 --restart=Never /bin/sh -c "while sleep 0.01; do wget -q -O- <app URL>; done"
   ```

- **Observing increasing in pod replicas due to increase in load.**
   ```bash
   kubectl get hpa guestbook --watch
   ```

   ![Increase in Pod Replicas by Autoscaling after Increasing Load on Server](/images/hpa2.png)

### 4. Performing Rolling Updates and Rollbacks on Guestbook Application

- **Changing index.html, building and pushing updated app image.**
  ```bash
  docker build . -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 && docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1
  ```

  ![Pushing Updated App Image](/images/upguestbook.png)

- **Changing resource requests and limits in the deployments.yml from 50 and 20 milli-cores to 5 and 2 milli-cores repectively. Applying the deployment.**

  ![Updated Deployment](/images/deployment.png)

- **Port forward again and get Replica Sets.**

  ![Get replica sets after updating deployment](/images/rs_before.png)

  We see that a new replica set is created and is running. The previous one is stopped.

- **Relaunching Application**

  ![Relaunch Application](/images/up-app.png)

  We see v2 in Application Title. This means rollout was successful.

- **Checking details of Revision of the deployment rollout.**
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployments guestbook --revision=2
  ```
  
  ![Details of Revision of Deployment Rollout](/images/rev.png)

- **Undo the Deloyment and Set to Revision 1, Re-check which replica sets are running post rollback.**
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deployment/guestbook --to-revision=1
  ```

  ![Replica Sets post rollback](/images/rs.png)

  We see that new replica set is stopped and the original one is running again


### 5. Deploying the Application to OpenShift
- **Image Stream pointing to my image in IBM Cloud Container Registry.**
   ```bash
   oc tag us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 guestbook:v1 --reference-policy=local --scheduled
   ```

   With the --reference-policy=local option, a copy of the image from IBM Cloud Container Registry is imported into the local cache of the internal registry and made available to the clusterâ€™s projects as an image stream. The --scheduled option sets up periodic importing of the image from IBM Cloud Container Registry into the internal registry. The default frequency is 15 minutes.

- **Launching OpenShift Web Console, Adding new application using Container Image in Developer Perspective, Viewing in Topology View, Using Route Link from Topology View to Launch App.**

  Topology View:

  Application:
  
  Forgot to take a photo of the launched application :(

- **Updaing index.html, Building and Pushing App using same image tag, and Updating Image Stream**
  ```bash
  docker build . -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 && docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1
  ```

  Either wait for 15 minutes for automatic scheduled image import (--scheduled flag used earlier) or run following command to update the image.
  ```bash
  oc import-image guestbook:v1 --from=us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 --confirm
  ```

  ![OpenShift Image import](/images/openshift_image_import.png)

- **Viewing Image Streams in Adminstrator Perspective.**

  ![OpenShift Image Streams](/images/openshift_image_streams.png)

  We see 2 entries. This means OpenShift imported our new image

- **Relaunching Application using Route Link in Topology View in Developer Perspective**

### 6. Using Redis Master for Storage

- **Clicking on /info (an information endpoint for the guestbook) on the app web page**

  ![OpenShift In-memory datastore (not redis)](/images/not_redis.png)

  Currently, we have only deployed the guestbook web front end, so it is using in-memory datastore to keep track of the entries. This is not very resilient, however, because any update or even a restart of the Pod will cause the entries to be lost.

- **Deleting application from Topology View, Creating Redis master Deployment, Verifying Deployments and Pods creation, Creating Redis master Service.**
  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
  oc get deployments
  oc get pods
  ```

  ![Redis master Deployment and Pods](/images/redis_master_deployment_pods.png)

  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-master-service.yaml
  ```

  Services find the Pods to load balance based on Pod labels. The Pod created in previous step has the labels app=redis and role=master. The selector field of the Service determines which Pods will receive the traffic sent to the Service.

- **Creating Redis slave Deployment, Verifying Deployments and Pods were created, Creating Redis slave Service.**
  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml
  oc get deployments
  oc get pods
  ```

  ![Redis slave Deployment and Pods](/images/redis_slave_deployment_pods.png)

  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-slave-service.yaml
  ```

- **Creating Redis slave Deployment, Verifying Deployments and Pods were created, Creating Redis slave Service.**
  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml
  oc get deployments
  oc get pods
  ```

  ![Redis slave Deployment and Pods](/images/redis_slave_deployment_pods.png)

  ```bash
  oc apply -f redis-slave-service.yaml
  ```

- **Adding second version of guestbook app using this GitHub repo, Viewing guestbook deployment in Topology View.**

  ![OpenShift Final Deployment](/images/openshift_final_deployment.png)

- **Viewing Final Application using Route Link**

  ![OpenShift Application Version 2](/images/openshift_app_v2.png)

- **Information Endpoint**

  ![OpenShift Application Version 2 information endpoint](/images/openshift_app_v2_info_endpoint.png)

  Now we get information on Redis instead of "In-memory datastore (not redis)" since we're no longer using the in-memory datastore.
